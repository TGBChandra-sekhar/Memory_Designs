# Synchronous FIFO (Sync FIFO)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **parameterized Synchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out)** buffer in **Verilog HDL**, where both read and write operations are performed using a **single common clock**.  
The design is suitable for buffering data between modules operating in the **same clock domain**.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Single-clock synchronous FIFO architecture  
- Parameterizable data width and depth  
- Full and Empty flag generation  
- Safe read and write pointer management  
- Supports continuous back-to-back read/write operations  
- Synthesizable and FPGA-friendly design  

---

## 🧱 FIFO Architecture
- **Write Pointer (wptr):** Controls write address increment  
- **Read Pointer (rptr):** Controls read address increment  
- **Memory Array:** Stores FIFO data  
- **Status Flags:**  
  - `full` – Indicates FIFO is full  
  - `empty` – Indicates FIFO is empty  

Both pointers are updated on the **same clock edge**, ensuring simple control logic and reliable operation.
